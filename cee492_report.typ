    Predictive Risk Modeling for Safety Interventions in Transportation Networks Using Spatial Crime History
  ],
  abstract: 
  [ Integrating personal safety into transportation and pedestrian planning requires systematic use of crime data. Information on crime location, time, and type can be analyzed to identify unsafe streets, intersections, and transit hubs, uncovering vulnerable areas in the urban network. Such insights enable engineers to propose design interventions such as reducing dead-end streets, improving pedestrian connectivity, and strategically relocating public transit drop-off points to enhance safety.

In this study, raw crime record data will be transformed into actionable hotspot maps and predictive risk models to optimize the allocation of traffic police and patrol routes, ensuring coverage in the areas of highest need. Using advanced machine learning techniques, the study predicts crime types based on factors such as location, time of day, victim profile, and premises description. These results provide Civil Engineers and Urban Planners with evidence-based tools to prioritize infrastructure improvements and safety investments, while also identifying specific locations likely to evolve into future hotspots for proactive deployment of patrols, surveillance, and safety infrastructure.

Together, these predictive and spatial approaches are expected to enhance response efficiency and guide long-term city planning initiatives—from upgrading street lighting and redesigning public spaces to improving transit accessibility and targeting community resources—thereby strengthening the overall resilience and safety of urban infrastructure.

= Description of Dataset
    The dataset used for this project is the #strong[#emph[ “Crime Data from 2020 to Present”]] dataset for the City of Los Angeles, which is publicly available on DATA.GOV @lapd_crime2020. It is maintained and released by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) as part of the city’s open-data initiative, based on official crime reports filed by law enforcement officers.

    The dataset is provided in CSV format and contains over 1 million rows of crime incidents. The full dataset consists of 28 columns, while our project will focus on the following 12 key attributes:

    - `DR_NO (Text)`: Division of Records Number: Official file number made up of a 2 digit year, area ID, and 5 digits.
    - `Date Rptd (Floating and Timestamp)`: Date the incident was reported.
    - `DATE OCC (Floating and Timestamp)`: Date the incident occurred.  
    - `TIME OCC (Text)`: Time the incident occurred.
    - `AREA (Text)`: Area where the incident occurred.
    - `AREA NAME (Text)`: ID of the area where the incident occurred.
    - `Rpt Dist No (Text)`: A four-digit code that represents a sub-area within a Geographic Area.
    - `Vict Age (Text)`: Age of the victim.
    - `Vict Sex (Text)`: Sex of the victim.
  - `Vict Descent (Text)`: Descent of the victim.
    - `LAT (Number)`: Latitude coordinate of the incident.
    - `LON (Number)`: Longitude coordinate of the incident.

    This dataset provides both spatial (latitude/longitude, area, district) and socio-demographic (victim age, sex, descent) attributes, along with temporal information (date and time of crime occurrence), enabling spatial, temporal, and predictive risk modeling for transportation safety interventions.

   == Temporal Patterns



   == Spatial Patterns

Another important aspect of our exploratory data analysis is the spatial distribution of crimes across Los Angeles. By mapping the latitude–longitude of each incident, we visualize hotspots and identify areas with high crime density.

We work with three spatial datasets: the set of crime points $C = \{C_i\}_{i=1}^{N_c}$, the set of street-lamp points $L = \{L_l\}_{l=1}^{N_l}$, and the city-boundary polygon $B$. We ensure longitudes and latitudes are numeric, finite, and within plausible ranges so that subsequent geometry remains meaningful.

Figure @fig:la-top500 ranks Los Angeles (city) LAPD reporting districts by
total reported incidents (2020–present). The x-axis lists districts in
descending order (leftmost = highest), and the y-axis shows incident counts.
The distribution is heavy-tailed: a few districts concentrate many incidents,
followed by a long tail of moderate activity.

Figure @fig:la-top500-ranked shows the top 500 LAPD reporting districts
sorted by total incidents, with the x-axis as rank (left = highest).
The y-axis is the incident count. The curve is heavy-tailed: a few
districts account for many incidents, followed by a long taper of
moderate counts across the remaining ranked districts.

This map @fig:lights plots the reported street-light point locations for Los Angeles in geographic
coordinates (longitude/latitude). The high point density makes many neighborhoods appear
as solid filled regions, revealing broad coverage across the city and sparser coverage
near edges and open spaces. Axes are in degrees to match the source data.

=== Finding relationship between crime locations and street lights

We project all coordinates into a single metric CRS so distances are measured in meters:

$((x_i, y_i) = Φ(λ_i, φ_i), space (u_l, v_l) = Φ(λ'_l, φ'_l))$

*where:*
- $(λ_i,φ_i)$ and $(λ'_l,φ'_l)$ are geographic (lon/lat, degrees) for crime $C_i$ and lamp $L_l$,
- Φ denotes the projection to a local metric CRS,
- $(x_i,y_i)$ and $(u_l,v_l)$ are projected (planar) coordinates in meters.

A local projected CRS is used because Euclidean lengths in degrees are not physically meaningful, and a single metric CRS avoids unit mismatches.

We restrict the analysis to the jurisdiction by clipping points to the city polygon $B$, keeping only crimes and lamps whose projected coordinates fall inside $B$. This removes out-of-area points and reduces boundary artifacts that would otherwise inflate nearest-distance values.

We define planar Euclidean distance between a crime and a lamp:
$ 
d(C_i, L_l) = sqrt((x_i - u_l)^2 + (y_i - v_l)^2)
$

For each crime, we keep its nearest-lamp distance:
$d_i = \min_{1 \le l \le N_l} d(C_i, L_l), \qquad i=1,...,n,$
where $n$ is the number of crimes inside $B$. This yields a single, interpretable proximity value per incident. A spatial index keeps these queries fast.

From $\{d_i\}_{i=1}^n$ we build the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF):
$F(r) = frac(1,n) sum_(i=1)^n bold(1){d_i <= r}, quad r >= 0,$
so the coverage at an operational radius $R$ is simply:
$"Coverage"(R) = F(R).$

We report robust summaries of proximity (median) and tail behavior (p90, p99) along with the maximum distance. Quantiles are preferred over the mean because the distribution is typically right-skewed and outlier-sensitive.

To guard against faulty records, we flag implausible distances above a conservative cap and, if needed, compute robust z-scores using the median and MAD to identify unusual $d_i$ values.

Finally, to see how coverage accumulates with distance, we partition $r$ into analyst-chosen bands (e.g., $0$–$50$–$100$–$250$ m, …) and tabulate the share of crimes whose nearest-lamp distance falls into each band. This “coverage by band” view highlights where most gains occur (very small radii) and where diminishing returns set in as the radius grows.

// Separate explanation paragraph (Typst)
Figure @fig:crime-nearest shows a histogram of distances (meters) from each
crime point to its nearest street light, limited to the 99th percentile to
avoid outliers. Most crimes fall very close to a light (left-heavy bar mass),
and the frequency declines rapidly with distance. The vertical orange line
marks the chosen radius R used later as a working cutoff for proximity.

Table @tab:la-dist-summary-typed summarizes the distance from each reported
crime in Los Angeles to its nearest street light. It shows total valid
records, distribution percentiles (p25–p99), the maximum, and how many / what
share fall within the working radius *R = 100 m*. Most crimes are close to a
light, with a long right tail driven by a small set of far-out points.
