    Predictive Risk Modeling for Safety Interventions in Transportation Networks Using Spatial Crime History
  ],
  abstract: 
  [ Integrating personal safety into transportation and pedestrian planning requires systematic use of crime data. Information on crime location, time, and type can be analyzed to identify unsafe streets, intersections, and transit hubs, uncovering vulnerable areas in the urban network. Such insights enable engineers to propose design interventions such as reducing dead-end streets, improving pedestrian connectivity, and strategically relocating public transit drop-off points to enhance safety.

In this study, raw crime record data will be transformed into actionable hotspot maps and predictive risk models to optimize the allocation of traffic police and patrol routes, ensuring coverage in the areas of highest need. Using advanced machine learning techniques, the study predicts crime types based on factors such as location, time of day, victim profile, and premises description. These results provide Civil Engineers and Urban Planners with evidence-based tools to prioritize infrastructure improvements and safety investments, while also identifying specific locations likely to evolve into future hotspots for proactive deployment of patrols, surveillance, and safety infrastructure.

Together, these predictive and spatial approaches are expected to enhance response efficiency and guide long-term city planning initiatives—from upgrading street lighting and redesigning public spaces to improving transit accessibility and targeting community resources—thereby strengthening the overall resilience and safety of urban infrastructure.

= Description of Dataset
    The dataset used for this project is the #strong[#emph[ “Crime Data from 2020 to Present”]] dataset for the City of Los Angeles, which is publicly available on DATA.GOV @lapd_crime2020. It is maintained and released by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) as part of the city’s open-data initiative, based on official crime reports filed by law enforcement officers.

    The dataset is provided in CSV format and contains over 1 million rows of crime incidents. For computational feasibility on personal laptops, we will reduce the working dataset to approximately 100,000 rows. The full dataset consists of 28 columns, while our project will focus on the following 12 key attributes:

    - `DR_NO (Text)`: Division of Records Number: Official file number made up of a 2 digit year, area ID, and 5 digits.
    - `Date Rptd (Floating and Timestamp)`: Date the incident was reported.
    - `DATE OCC (Floating and Timestamp)`: Date the incident occurred.  
    - `TIME OCC (Text)`: Time the incident occurred.
    - `AREA (Text)`: Area where the incident occurred.
    - `AREA NAME (Text)`: ID of the area where the incident occurred.
    - `Rpt Dist No (Text)`: A four-digit code that represents a sub-area within a Geographic Area.
    - `Vict Age (Text)`: Age of the victim.
    - `Vict Sex (Text)`: Sex of the victim.
    - `Vict Descent (Text)`: Descent of the victim.
    - `LAT (Number)`: Latitude coordinate of the incident.
    - `LON (Number)`: Longitude coordinate of the incident.

    This dataset provides both spatial (latitude/longitude, area, district) and socio-demographic (victim age, sex, descent) attributes, along with temporal information (date and time of crime occurrence), enabling spatial, temporal, and predictive risk modeling for transportation safety interventions.
